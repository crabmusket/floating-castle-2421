This [Yesod][] website is a basic example that is deployable to [Heroku][].
I have a few simple goals to achieve:

 * Use MongoDB backend
 * Render items using Markdown
 * Load new entries asynchronously
 * Update and delete entries
 * Respond to page focus/blur for visual cues

 [Yesod]: yesodweb.com
 [Heroku]: heroku.com
